st.markdown("""
I'm on a journey to learn coding to develop language apps that are **_customized_** and **_learner-centered_**, 
rather than relying on solutions that don't necessarily fit my students and classroom. 

My goal is to create **_simple_** but **_interactive_** tools that make language learning more engaging and effective. I'm excited to share this process with you as we explore new, impactful ways to teach languages.
