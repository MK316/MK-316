I'm on a journey to learn coding to develop language apps that are customized and learner-centered, rather than relying on solutions that don't necessarily fit my students and classroom. My goal is to create interactive tools that make language learning more engaging and effective. I'm excited to share this process with you as we explore new, impactful ways to teach languages.
